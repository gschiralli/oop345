This workshop helped me review concepts I learned in oop244 such as the rule of three and dealing with class resources. This was useful for the upgraded event class that used dynamic memory to hold a string of an unknown length. Some of the new concepts I learned from this workshop were internal and external linkage. An example of internal linkage in this workshop is the static int counter in the display method. The static variable exists for the lifetime of the unit that it is defined in, which in this case is the display function. This is useful in this workshop because the variable is able to exist once and count how many times the method display() is called by incrementing it. An example of external linkage in this workshop would be the extern size_t g_sysClock variable. The external linkage allows this variable to be accessible throughout the whole program. In short internal linkage allows access through the scope of a single translation unit and external linkage allows for access beyond the translation unit it is declared in. In addition to these topics, I also learned how to receive arguments from the command line.
